-Added Player Hitboxes & Damage Multipliers
-Added Player Damage Security Checking:
   -Very basic, just checks if the hit player is within
     range, and applies damage with multiplier based
     on appendage hit
-Implemented player power stat, sync'd across network
-Implemented power loss from: moving & shooting
-Implemented a rough system for charging stations
    and their functionality

Issues:
-Non-Movement related animation events aren't syncd
-Charging station "Over Charging" damages player but doesn't kill them
-Newly connected players don't place already spawned/equiped
    items in the inventories of those who have the items
